Relating crop production to weather requires an index that is relatively specific to a local area. A single index is preferable in economic analysis to avoid including many weather variables that may be highly intercorrelated and to preserve degrees of freedom for testing the models chosen. The unique feature of the reported index is the use of readily available data and the direct estimation of the effect of weather on yield per acre. The resulting weather index was found to be reasonably accurate, and thus suitable for use in studies concerned with such diverse topics as the benefits of environmental control and the stability of farm income.

After an outline of the historical background, stressing the dependence of Czechoslovak economy and of her industrial structure on external relations, the position of Czechoslovakia is assessed during Khrushchev's attempts to integrate the East European countries. The main attention, however, is paid to the period after December 1966 when top Czechoslovak organs took the decision to start profound economic reforms in the field of foreign trade-as the first East European country and without consulting other COMECON members. The most important instrument, the so-called ""inner price adjustment"", has been employed since January 1st, 1967, i.e. one year before Hungary has introduced it, too. It interconnects the domestic wholesale prices with the foreign trade prices in such a way as to make the difference part of the financial results of the enterprises instead of former budgetary financing. Within the framework of other measures this device would make it ultimately possible to reach convertibility of the Czechoslovak crown. During the first half of 1968 theoretical efforts were aimed at foreign trade liberalization and such a policy was partly executed. Finally, two theories of ""socialist integration"" are sketched which have emerged in Eastern Europe on both official and theoretical levels since august 1968 as a consequence of the above-mentioned Czechoslovak developments.

The evolving control structures have not kept the world's poverty at tolerable levels, and leaders in all countries are seeking more effective means to meet this grave challenge of our age. A negative income tax is one of these mechanisms being studied. In this paper we consider the merits of this plan as implemented in a developing region — the rural areas of the Ozarks — and compare them with the merits of the present public assistance program in the United States. The relevance of the study extends to all affluent societies. Applying the negative income tax to a cross section of households in the rural portion of the Ozarks Region raises questions concerning its overall effectiveness if instituted without modification. The primary issues relate to its distributive effects. Although coverage under the Friedman Negative Tax Plan is much broader than that under current welfare plans, the gap between a target income and disposable income under, the plan is not greatly decreased except at prohibitively high negative tax rates. Many former welfare recipients would receive less total income under the plan. The bulk of the negative tax payments would be received by younger multiple‐member families, and their work incentives might be reduced. Furthermore, costs of a negative tax plan would likely be high. © 1968 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","",""

Their objections to tenancy have been based on inefficient resource use and lack of incentives. Further, both in the U.S. and in Canada, it has been assumed that a society of predominantly land owning farmers contributes to political stability. However, an analysis of the data for Canada shows that during the period 1921–66 there has been a growth in land rental but this growth has not inhibited the commercialization, specialization and general development of agriculture. Hence, Canadian economists who are called upon, in increasing numbers, to advise developing countries on measures to develop agriculture have to be wary of prejudging tenancy as inefficent per se but should examine the actual working of tenancy systems for elements which induce inefficiencies. LA COMMERCIALISATION DEL'AGRICULTURE CANADIENNE ‐ Depuis longtemps, les économistes appuient la croyance que les terres arables devraient ètre posséder par le fermier. Les objections à la location sont basées sur l'incompétence des ressources d'usages et le manque d'encouragement. De plus, nous présumons qu'une société de propriétaire de ferme contribuera largement à la stabüité politique. Une analyse de ces données au Canada démontre que durant les années 1921–66, une croissance dans la location des terres n'a nullement aidé au développement agricole. Désormais, les économistes canadiens qui sont appelés en pita grand nombre à renseigner les pays en voie de développement, devraient être prudent avant de préjuger l'incompétence de la location, mats plutôt examiné les éléments qui occasionnent cette incompétence. © 1969 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","",""

MORTON and Zauberman start from a discussion of the von Neumann‐type equilibrium in a long term economic plan. They then turn to several specific issues which have been for some time focal in Soviet planning thought and analyse the significance for them of the von Neumann model. These are in particular the nexus between the pace of the economy's growth and investment efficiency—traditionally recognized as central in the advance for Soviet economy; further the problems of efficiency and profit rates and in general the efficiency parameters (pricing).

It is interesting that the income distributional effects prompted a change rather than efficiency or investment effects. In late 1953 a new system incorporating the acutioning of foreign exchange to importers in a price bidding market was designed to transfer all windfalls to the government.

Technical farm production decisions are becoming less difficult relative to financial decisions. Financial management is not only becoming more important but is vitally connected with problems of what is going to happen to family firms; what form of business organization should they use to acquire capital, how should they obtain capital, and how should management be obtained and organized. Financial institutions are also facing some serious questions for which answers are scarce, not only because of lack of available information, but also because of conceptual voids. This paper discusses these problems particularly as they relate to relevant areas for research inquiry. It is unlikely that the changes giving rise to the need for more attention to the agricultural finance areas will slow down in the foreseeable future. Financial parameters will be the major determinants of the entrepreneurial independence of family size and large food and natural fiber producers. The financial problems already confronting farming are numerous and complex, and the task ahead for the agricultural economists is great since time cannot be neutral in its effect if progress is to be achieved. © 1968 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","",""

This paper looks at some challenges facing a familiar institution to agriculture — the cooperative. While other problem areas often considered distant to agriculture are focused on, it is apparent that there is much interdependence between rural and urban problems and institutional change in helping bring about solutions. With present urban problems and their likelihood of persisting for some time, the encouragement of farm people to become city dwellers may need to be more seriously appraised. Similarly there is a need for better understanding of the role of institutions, their jobs, and the socio‐economic impact of alternate means in achieving them before real progress can be broadly achieved. © 1968 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","",""

The method of step‐wise regression with the introduction of zero‐one variables is the principal technique for examining feed input/output relationships and their reflection in economic terms. Five basic dependent variables are considered: yield per cow, stocking density, output per forage acre, utilised starch equivalent per forage acre and margin over feed cost per forage acre. The discussion of the results argues the overwhelming importance of stocking rate in the profitability of milk production and that on many farms concentrates are being used at uneconomic levels. The latter part of the paper considers variation in labour productivity and argues the existence of economies of scale in the use of labour regardless of the system of herd operation.

In the more remote areas where guiding is a significant activity, agriculture is often depressed. Such complementary non‐farm sources of income are attracting increasing attention as a means of mitigating the “farm problem” in these situations. This study attempts an evaluation of the economic contribution of non‐resident hunting and the associated guiding industry in a region of British Columbia where guiding is an important adjunct to low‐income ranching. The net economic gain from non‐resident hunting is calculated, as are the private profits of guiding. These appear surprisingly low, though there is wide variation in the profitability of guiding. Public administrative policies are probably responsible in part for the failure of this industry to rationalize itself and for underutilization of game resources. © 1968 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","",""

It has been found that the general principles of optimal government intervention remain inviolate both in the ‘static’ welfare‐economics world and in the context of ‘growth’. The vast existing literature on the subject has been critically examined in order to drive home to the reader the main message of the present paper: that arguments for using protection as a primary instrument to remove domestic distortion, arising either from external economies, monopoly elements in production or a rural‐urban wage differential, or from a differential in the rates of transformation between present and future goods are in effect arguments for providing subsidies on domestic production. Also protection is a wasteful policy in order to promote saving and investment. Instead it is far better to achieve this objective more directly by using appropriate fiscal policies. However, under certain conditions, protection may prove beneficial by attracting foreign investors to set up joint projects in the country. The novelty of the general approach of this paper lies in relating the argument to Tinbergen's‘targets—and—instruments’ approach. More emphasis is given in the paper to the infant‐industry argument and the use of tariff to attract foreign capital. This last and the growth‐promotion‐through‐saving argument are the two new topics, not covered in the existing literature, that have been discussed at length in this paper.

The amount of information in regard to market conduct in this area is isolated and fragmented. Current measurements of concentration and market power include no subjective values or operational conduct variables. The value judgments and conduct of the participants in the market place are not considered. This article presents a theoretical discussion in developing a measurement which could help in rectifying the above shortcomings. The development of a competitive rating index would pressure agricultural economists to rely less readily on traditional measures of market power in drawing conclusions and to examine with greater care the conventional relationship which is alleged to exist between market structure conduct and performance. The inclusion of the above indices into one competitive rating index gives us a tool which would allow economists to study the relative position of each firm hi a national, regional or local environment. The type of competition can be classified. The stages that various markets pass through as markets develop in their use of price and non‐price competition can be reviewed. Weighted indices could also be evaluated, i.e., if an index of advertising and promotion were included, it would be possible to weight this index by market share to gauge the possible impact on competitive intensity. The use of the many sub‐indices would facilitate decisions by management and management consultants, in regard to rectifying weaknesses which exist in the competitive tactics of the individual firm. It would thus increase the ability of the firm to initiate countermoves and thus introduce a stronger competitive tone into the market place [5, pp. 471–476]. A careful and continuing analysis of the sub‐indices by policy makers would enable them to initiate control procedures without the “hue and cry” of a Royal Commission. © 1968 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","",""

A comparison is made of alternative estimators of the parameters of consumer demand functions. The article points to difficulties raised by using a priori coefficients for one variable (eg. income elasticity) as a means of developing an accurate estimate of another coefficient (eg. price elasticity), and indicates evidence of multicollinearity depressing estimated consumer price elasticities.

Since the paradigm's functions are both regulative and cognitive, this process has sociological as well as purely epistcmological aspects. With the exception of the Keynesian revolution of the 1930's, there have been no phases of paradigm change in economics quite like those in the natural sciences. This is due mainly to the nature of economic paradigms (or ‘basic’ theories) which are less precise and less liable to falsification. ‘Critical anomalies’ and ‘crucial experiments’ do not arise in economics, as in the natural sciences; and yet the process of paradigm change may serve as an ideal type, which can be used to clarify the interrelationships between the terminological, conceptual, personal, and professional elements involved in the development of economic ideas, especially in such episodes as the emergence of classical (Ricardian) economics, the Methodenslreit, or the marginal utility revolution.

In competitive elections, these 3% are a highly significant proportion. Since this change largely favors the Gaullists, one can suggest that the French Left (Communist and Non-Communist) has not manipulated candidate selections as successfully as the Gaullists. Although the patterns of variation are different for Gaullist candidates than for Federation or Communist candidates, we have shown that the performances of new candidates differ systematically from those of old, repeat candidates. Thus, we hope this research suggests the interest of looking at candidate selection strategies and the communications psychology of multiple exposures as relevant variables in the study of voting behavior. The early study of voting behavior was largely influenced by looking at the social determinants of voting behavior through such variables as social class, religious practice, race, etc. The use of psychological theory in the study of voting behavior has, in fact, largely been confined to the analysis of the cross-pressures evidenced through these social variables. In other works, we have indicated how elite behavior influences voting behavior through coalition decisions. To this we can now partially suggest how elite behavior influences voting behavior through candidate selection decision. With as much empirical knowledge about elite influences as we now have about social influences, the variations in behavior that we must ascribe to the peculiarities of districts and their candidates may well be very minor. © 1969 Center for Studies in Public Choice, Department of Economics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute.","",""

This view is based on the belief that, in practice, the farmer finds himself involved with choice from a relatively narrow, and obvious, set of technically feasible, efficient farm plans. His main problem in the choice of a farm plan is seen as the estimation of the probability that the various possible financial outcomes will be achieved, since the possible effects of the latter on his future list of choices cannot be ignored. The type of data believed to be needed is described, and a line of theoretical analysis followed which is meant to underline the importance of this data, and to develop principles for use in its production.

First it is assumed that the decision-maker has complete information about both his current and future investment opportunities in which case the decision problem reduces basically to a computing problem. Second it is assumed that the decision maker has complete information about his current investment opportunities and a knowledge of his expectations about future investment opportunities. The authors analyze the logic underlying the selection of the capital growth (discount) rate that should be used in determining whether a marginal increment of investment should be accepted or rejected. If the marginal increment were rejected, the unused cash would typically be invested temporarily in a highly liquid investment at a relatively low interest rate with the prospect that a better than marginal investment would absorb the funds at the next decision time. The analysis led to the formulation of a capital-budgeting decision criterion, called the Maximum Prospective Value Criterion, which is presented in this article. As its name implies, the criterion is designed to select the set of investments that has the maximum prospective value, given the decision-maker's expectations about his future investment opportunities. This criterion relates the capital-budgeting decision to the opportunity-cost and marginal-analysis concepts of classical economics. The present-worth criterion of engineering economy is shown to be a special case of the Maximum Prospective Value Criterion, and the minimum at tractive rate of return of engineering economy when properly selected appears to be closely related to the capital growth rate on the marginal increment of investment. © 1968 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Basically, farm operators believe that the individual farmer is in no position to bargain effectively in a product market with a few large firms. Legislators have responded to the wishes of farm operators by enacting legislation which provides for the formation of compulsory marketing boards controlled by producers. An ever‐increasing number of these boards are now in operation. The granting of exclusive powers to sell particular farm products, however, is one which involves the public interest and the public is, therefore, vitally interested. This paper focuses attention on the exercise of the powers vested in these marketing boards through their use of quotas, and their limitations to entry of new producers into particular sectors of the agricultural industry. The paper indicates that there are some positive features to the quota policies pursued by marketing boards. Some economic security has been afforded farm operators with short‐term stability engendered in particular sectors of agriculture. There are certain negative consequences of these quota policies, which affect the location of production and also impair the competitive strength of particular sectors of agriculture to which they are applied. They have also interfered with the most rational utilization of resources in associated industries. These aspects of the quota policies are, therefore, inconsistent with the public interest. The study outlines principles that should form the basis of a revitalized marketing policy that may be more consistent with the public interest. © 1968 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","",""

(i) given some particular preference-patterns of the individual voters, the result of the voting, i.e. the ""social"" ordering of the available alternatives, lacks the property of transitivity; (2) the intensities of the preferences of the different groups of voters will not be taken into consideration by a simple majority rule as long as the possibility of a voter's strategy and of logrolling are excluded. The most important question to be answered is to which degree these objections against the use of the majority rule are overcome by introducing the possibility of (explicit) logrolling. An attempt is also made to answer the question if, from the point of view of welfare economics the result of voting after logrolling is superior to the result of voting without logrolling. To simplify the analysis the voters are supposed to be ""rational beings""; all normative aspects of their attitude towards the result of the voting procedure or towards the decision-rule itself are eliminated. The analysis shows that the process of negotiations, meant to result in a majority-transaction for a number of winning alternatives will in many instances take a circular course, i.e. it does not, in the game-theoretic sense, produce a stable solution. If one applies the Paretian criterion for an increase in social welfare, a statement concerning the welfare aspect of logrolling is shown to be possible only in a very limited number of situations. In some cases logrolling provides a solution for the problem of intransitivity. A welfare judgment about this solution is not possible. Finally a paper on logrolling by J. S. Coleman is commented upon. © 1969 De Erven F. Bohn N.V.","",""

Although growth is the predominate characteristic of departments and disciplines, we observe and can predict decline in several instances. With the use of multiple regression analysis, state nonfarm income emerges as the most important variable explaining total funds available to experiment stations. Rural farm population has virtually no effect on total funds available. In fact, since 1960 it was somewhat of a detriment for an agricultural experiment station to be located in an agricultural state. At the departmental level, the departments engaged in farm oriented research (Agronomy, animal husbandry, etc.) appear to be more dependent on farm income for support whereas departments in closer contact with the nonfarm sector (Horticulture, agricultural economics, etc.) are more dependent on nonfarm income. Predictions for the early 1970's indicate largest growth for departments located in the high income, urban-industrial states particularly for those more closely tied to nonfarm income. © 1969, Oxford University Press.","",""

Cost reduction induced by county consolidation depends primarily upon three major variables. These are: (1) the economies of scale with respect to population, (2) population density and distribution in the given area of proposed consolidation and, (3) increased private and public transportation costs induced by consolidation. The major conclusions of the study were as follows: (1) economies of population were found to be small by this study and several others reviewed. Furthermore, apparent population economies appear substantially exhausted at population levels of 10,000 to 15,000, (2) increased private and public transit costs exhausted a large part of the population economy impact of consolidation and, (3) distribution of costs and benefits of consolidation was not equal over the entire population.

Les principals conclusions de cette étude sont les suivantes: (1) les économies de population se sont, révélées petites comme d'ailleurs d'autres études citées, de plus les économies apparentes de population semblent se réduire à zéro aux niveaux de 10,000 à 15,000, (2) l'augmentation des coûts de transport public et privé diminue de beaucoup l'effet d'économie de population dans le remembrement et, (3) dans l'ensemble de la population, les coûts et les bénéfices du remembrement ne sont pas distribués également. © 1969 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","",""

Exogene time is interpreted as the abstract frame within which adaptation of economic variables can take place; endogene time is defined as the periods of time as experienced in concreto by human subjects. Using the endogene concept of time in an economic analysis means that the analysis can be extended to the wider structural field in which the economic phenomenon one wishes to study is situated in concrete chronological order as experienced in reality. The author tries to show that by introducing the time factor in the analysis as happens in dynamic economics the exogene and endogene time elements are both incorporated in economic theory. This means that the analysis is extended not only to the time element which gives room for inter-periodical adaptation, but also that the economic phenomena can be shown in the perspective, opened by the broadening of the field in which they appear in reality, as happens with regard to certain theories of economic growth. In the author's opinion this shows that extending an economic analysis to the time element ought to be done not only by adding this factor as if it were a mere complementary entity. Time spans reality in its entirety; one cannot cut it into pieces within reality's modal (economic) sphere. Therefore, the introduction of the time element into economic analysis implies an approach towards understanding the continual progress as shown in the reality sector, but also towards understanding the connection between economic and other aspects of reality. © 1969 De Erven F.

These problems embrace all agricultural production, since equipment durable assets are used in the production of all farm commodities. Nevertheless, and recognition of these problems is perhaps most important for tree based commodities. This paper demonstrates a method for incorporating decisions about adding or removing durable capital, and applies the technique to the analysis of Brazilian coffee production. The model suggested has wide application to tree fruit production as well, and with modifications to supply analysis for many other commodities.

It was found that wheat acreage response is not a random process. From a statistical standpoint, wheat and flax prices, wheat stocks on farms, and export sales did affect farmers' wheat acreage decisions. Among the elasticities computed, those for wheat prices were the largest but generally less than one. Barley prices, rainfall prior to seeding, and cattle prices were also considered but did not appear to have a serious influence on wheat acreage. © 1968 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","",""

The solution procedure suggested is relatively uncomplicated, requiring only quadratic programming routines available to most researchers. Estimates of price distributions which result from this approach can be quite useful for price forecasting and for decision making at firm and industry levels. The importance of the additional information obtained by solving these models stochastically is discussed in connection with a amplified model of the United States fall potato industry.

Les méthodes à employer dans le dirigisme économique sont aussi illustrées Monte Carlo simulation is not a substitute for proper theoretical model construction, nor is it a substitute for proper experimental design and statistical analysis. Rather Monte Carlo simulation is a method of performing experiments on functionally expressed models. As such, careful attention should be given to primary model construction, experimental design and statistical analysis. Although simulation procedures in general allow testing of various policies, decisions and rules relating to an operating system, Monte Carlo simulation facilitates a more vaned type of experimentation. This results from the random generation of finite observations for otherwise undefined functional relations. Monte Carlo is also well adapted to situations requiring an approximation of the stochastic influences often found in real world operating and decision systems. This is especially relevant when theoretical analysis is unable to relate certain phenomena. Monte Carlo techniques Frovide a means of experimentation from which statements of statistical inference may be made. Such inferences will facilitate logical consistency of analytical models.

This solution method was applied to two large problems: 1) corn havest, storage and feed processing, and 2) hog housing and manure handling; Three least cost building‐equipment systems were developed for alternative wage rates. A profit‐maximizing combination of enterprises was then developed with linear programming for each building‐equipment system. Comparison of net returns to the farm operator with each of the three systems allowed choice of the combination of enterprises and the building‐equipment system that resulted in the largest net return. While a simultaneous equipment‐enterprise selection method might have some advantages in developing solutions with slightly higher profit levels, the difficulties in constructing and solving such problems makes this technique unworkable at present.

These habits and philosophies are typical of the leadership of traditional countries and hinder the agricultural development of these countries in various ways, often leading to the adoption of unwise national agricultural policies. To transform traditional scholars into scientists who can and will analyze the policies and programs of their own country objectively and constructively, teachers in each area of specialization in agricultural economics should put more stress on practical measurement, the derivation of principles, and their application, and should draw upon examples from many parts of the world.

Indeed, among the problems which arise in the study of issues in which economic science and political science overlap are some of the most difficult as well as the most vital in the era which appears to be emerging. During the last decade, several works of importance have been published devoted to analysis of these issues. They are all broadly concerned with alternative yet complementary ways in which man's objectives may be sought, namely, via centralised, governmental decision‐making (whether democratically controlled or undemocratic) and via democratic consumers' sovereignty (i.e., via‘free’ markets). These studies have, in other words, concentrated attention upon two distinct and very different methods of exercising social discipline upon those who determine resource use — through governments (possibly disciplined by the ballot box) or through business entrepreneurs (disciplined by the loss‐avoidance, profit‐seeking sanctions).

Department I produces capital goods while Department II produces consumer goods (plus capital instruments specialized to their production). Some subsequent writers, following Bortkiewicz, have added a third department producing luxuries particularly metallic money. The writer has previously shown that the two‐sector Marxian model is transformable into a balanced Walrasian general‐equilibrium one, with a few functional relations interpreted as implicit in Marx, and a number of other relations treated as technically given, after the fashion of modern ‘linear economics’. In the present essay, the argument is generalized to the case where the two departments are further subdivided into n and m sectors respectively. The main substantive change turns out to be the addition of many more structural constants, which are taken as technically given. The second part of the essay returns to the two‐department level of aggregation and develops a diagrammatic representation of Marxian dynamics. Some Marxian writers stress the falling rate of profit, others the tendency toward overproduction, as the primary force for capitalist stagnation or breakdown. This presentation is among the minority which seeks to combine the two in a ‘dilemma’ model. Copyright © 1966, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved","",""

In the past it was easier t o acquire on the death of a landowner a large block of land but as this land becomes broken up and becomes less homogeneous as far as landownership is concerned, this will give rise t o many social and economic problems. Undoubtedly the dead hand of the past lies heavily on the present and future pattern of British agriculture. There is a need for a change in attitude towards the new class of landowners, and for research on the implication of continuing policies that were initiated in times when there was reaction against landownership held by a few privileged individuals. It is hkely that if attention is not paid to these aspects we are likely to see landownership being transferred to institutional bodies. The past system of landownership on a personal basis will be replaced by various institutional arrangements on a very impersonal basis. Owner‐occupiers (particularly those above 600 S.M.D.) faced with increasing charges for purchasing and servicing of landlord responsibilities will be forced to intensify their production and may demand greater support from government sources. It is suggested that as an immediate measure in addition to collecting information on a net farm income basis, data should be collected on the networth of individual farm businesses as well as of the industry as a whole. Non‐agriculutural presswes en on land values need tc be considered. In the marginal areas part‐time farming, together with tourism, or integration with other pursuits such as afforestation, appear to be sound enough proposals in general, but difficult to implement for the individual. More research work is required to assist us to deal with this problem of change of landownership and its interaction on the competing demands for capital. Copyright © 1967, Wiley Blackwell.

His early studies in agricultural prices, his pioneer use of statistical tools in price prediction, and his work on hybridizing corn are recalled. His work as Secretary included drafting competent agricultural economists for key posts in the Department, insisting on careful economic study as a prelude to decision making, establishing a Consumer's Council as a watchdog for consumer interests, and improving conditions for farmers through production control, soil conservation, government purchase and storage of surplus crops, rural resettlement, and rural electrification. As Vice-President, he created the Board of Economic Warfare and directed its planning toward achieving the right kind of peace. As Secretary of Commerce, he supported the Full Employment Act. After his retirement from public life, he continued to work on increasing the productivity of poultry and farm plants.

According to the so‐called ‘Equalization Doctrine’ the elimination of the spatial differences in economic growth is possible only by the adoption of a policy tackling with all regions and sectors in one all‐embracing action. Regarding the limited resources of the developing countries, however, this advice seems not to be of practical value.‐With this state of affairs it is tempting to enquire for inducement‐mechanisms conveying impulses of economic development from ‘leading regions’ or ‘growing points’ of a country to its lagging areas. Starting from HIRSCHMAN'S general ideas on unbalanced development, the author embarks on a discussion of PERROUX’‘Theory of Development‐poles’. An attempt is made to make PERROUX’ hypothesis more workable in defining effects of economic, institutional, psychological, and geographical polarization. The role of these effects as inducement‐mechanisms stimulating regional economic development is broadly analyzed. Special attention is paid in this context to the complementarity‐effects which are characterized as being powerful sequences of industrialization either in their working via technological interrelations or via market‐decisions. Comments concerning the possibilities of promoting small‐scale industries in the ‘polarized region’ and some remarks on the maximization of polarization‐effects by optimizing the development‐pole's set of industries constitute the final part of this essay in unbalanced regional development.

Changing farm problems will require major adjustments by agriculture and its advisors. Structural reform in farming and marketing arrangements of one kind or another will lead these adjustments. Clientele of extension economists will include producers (in two basic groups), agri‐business, non‐agricultural rural residents and consumers. Our approach should be on the basis of educators and we must keep up‐to‐date in the teaching methods and media used. Agricultural extension could logically become the center for a new broad program of continuing adult education. Subject matter areas of concern to the economist must be broadened to actively include marketing, processing and public affairs. A sound program of physical and economic research must be provided as a companion to effective extension work. Greater collaboration is necessary—both ways. Personnel for extension economics will be forthcoming only if salary adjustments are made and university curricula revised to better train extension people. Extension economists must use care and diplomacy in their relationships with University, Federal and Provincial officials. We still have responsibility to more completely demonstrate the usefulness of our knowledge to other extension workers, administrators, and the farm public. Recognition must also be given to working closely with advisors in agri‐business and private consulting firms. Program evaluation, internal and external, are essential for a healthy program in extension economics. Copyright © 1966, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved","",""

Even when the threat of shortages does exist, the concern of residents in the community for the plight of others helps to minimize serious problems during the emergency period. From the economic point of view it is important to note that post-disaster behavior by individuals helps to eliminate a source of demand for some commodities, thereby tending to keep prices lower than they would be if the same conditions of scarcity arose in a more normal impersonal market situation. Thus, if people remain with friends and relatives, a large demand for housing is temporarily taken off the market, and pressure on rents is minimized. Possible food shortages are avoided for the same reason - residents respond to urgings not to hoard and are easily satisfied with substitute products when their first choice is out of stock. Realtors and store owners are also hesitant to raise rents or food prices during the emergency period; in fact, selective reductions are often put into effect temporarily. These short-term response patterns indicate that sociological and psychological factors change to utility functions of residents during the short-run period and thus explain why economic behavior following a disaster appears at first glance to be somewhat peculiar. © 1967 the Thomas Jefferson Center for Jefferson Center for Political Economy, Rouss Hall, University of Virginia.","",""

Each social structure, a shop, an office, a club, has at the same time economic, political and sociological significance, and is also rooted in the past. Economic activity especially is embedded in non‐economic contexts not only in primitive or proto‐capitalistic societies ‐ as Karl Polanyi has stated ‐ but always and everywhere, and most economic activities are enveloped by economic contexts. Therefore, if one wants to understand the full meaning of social reality one has to look at it from the point of view of all the social sciences. Today this is often done in regional studies and in city planning. But this spotty kind of interdisciplinary collaboration is insufficient, especially because it does not lay the groundwork for an education in integrated social science. Such science would systematically study all the typical processes, in whatever part of society, which the individual disciplines analyze each from its own viewpoint. This unified kind of social science will exist only when in the scholarly world synthesis is recognized as an endeavor just as valuable and meritorious as specialized research. Recognition for synthesis in social science will also bring two practical problems closer to solution: How good teaching can receive more credit, since the synthesizing approach is essential for the teacher, and how we can loosen up the negative attitude which many of our students display toward scholarly effort because they feel that it is too hyper‐specialized to have much relevance to life problems.

First, after comparing the different indices proposed to measure the output of health services, a very simple one is adopted: the number of deaths. The objective of health planning is assumed to be the minimization of the number of deaths. Next, the optimum distribution of resources between prevention and cure of one particular disease is studied in some detail, and a numerical example is presented. Finally, the generalization of this model to include several diseases, under both static and dynamic conditions, is considered. Copyright © 1967, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved","",""

As a first step, Catholic (or Scholastic) ethical norms are incorporated into the familiar form of individual and social welfare functions. Because Church behavior ought to promote the welfare of the membership, these functions become, in turn, building blocks for a theory of hierarchical decisionmaking. The analysis establishes an analogy between the Church and an oligopolistic business firm and supports two principal conclusions. First, conditions for Pareto optimality which are consistent with Scholastic welfare criteria do not coincide with those of ordinary welfare economics. This is because individual preference (utility) functions often rank material over spiritual good, something which Scholastic functions may never do. Second, treated as objective functions, Scholastic welfare indices afford valuable insight into the doctrinal history of the Church: into the process governing secular changes in the Church's interpretation of the current moral implications of Natural Law.

Regional research should extend a warm welcome under an inspiring environment to well-qualified researchers. Suggestions for improvement of regional research include: (1) experimentation with programs of regional research in contrast to a series of narrowly defined, uncoordinated, short-term projects; (2) the appointment in some cases of regional coordinators to effectuate the policies and plans of regional committees; (3) the establishment of regional research centers with small staffs for certain types of projects; and (4) more flexibility in size and composition of regional committees. © 1968, Oxford University Press.","",""

As the growth models show a rather material orientation, it might be thought useful to look for the implicit assumptions that are made with respect to the behaviour pattern of consumers and producers, who ultimately govern the actual path of a process of economic growth. To do so fruitfully, the paper starts with a discussion of the role of preferences in economic theory. A distinction is made between individual and collective preferences. The opinion is expressed that up to now economic theory neglected the influence of collective preferences on main economic categories such as prices and income. The discussion of the neo‐classical and Harrod‐Domar growth models from the outlook of preferences leads among others, to the conclusion that the relation between imperfect competition and economic growth should be studied in more detail. All hitherto published growth models seem to start from the behaviour pattern of individuals that is compatible with perfect competition. Copyright © 1967, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved","",""

It is argued that while considerable precision is utilized in deriving conclusions from economic models, the degree of precision used in selecting the variables included in the model is very much less. The problems involved in constructing a theory of hypothesis building are discussed. The meaning of analyses where ‘casual empiricism’ has been used to select decision variables is examined and criticized. Possible approaches to the problem of interpretation of analytical results in such cases are outlined. The paper does not contain a proposal for a theory of theory construction, but merely calls attention to some of the problems involved in formulation of hypotheses in positive social sciences such as economics.

A critical task in appraising the efficiency of such an economy, then, is to determine whether and under what conditions this adding up process produces optimal results. The ‘smallness’ of the decisive, individual transactions—their limited size, scope and time‐perspective—can, it is argued, be a source of misallocations, in the sense that consumers might disapprove of the larger result thereby produced, if they were ever given the opportunity explicitly to vote for or against it. In certain circumstances, the smallness of the relevant decisions may produce authentic market failure. This will be the case where they do not include an independent appraisal of customers’ desire to keep available for possible future use a service that they do not actually use in sufficient amount to cover the costs of providing it. In other circumstances, the smallness of the individual transactions may encourage irrational consumer choice, because they are too small to justify the effort of securing good market information. In yet others, monopoly elements may cause the buyer to be presented with excessively narrow choices that do not correctly reflect that actual costs of the competing alternatives; and the result may be an uneconomic spiral of product quality changes over time so‐called ‘product inflation’. Finally, the cumulation of individual choices may have the ultimate effect of changing consumer preference function themselves, in which event it is not possible for welfare economics to judge the optimality of market performance. These possible defects of the market may be conceived in the more familiar terms—as attributable to externalities, market imperfections or the defects of consumer sovereignty itself. Emphasis on the contribution influence of the smallness of the controlling decisions has the virtue of suggesting the possible necessity of substituting a ‘large’ for a piecemeal accumulation of small decisions if the results are to be intelligently appraised or improved.

In his early publication Wesen und Hauptinhalt der theoretischen Nationalökonomie he separates entirely Economics and Sociology, but the ‘static’ theory (which neglects human action) inevitably leads to the ‘dynamic’ theory (which intends to centre again human action) in his Theorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung. Undoubtedly fundamental for his theory was not only the conception of numerically neither verifiable nor falsifiable qualitative mutations. But unfortunately through the sociological‐institutional basis of the book, the sociological prerequisites of the required innovations were failed to be recognized. Schumpeter intended a comprehensive theory of modern capitalism; in his view such a theory had to consist of the theories of origins, effects and decline of modern capitalism. The ‘effects’ he imagined to have developed by his above mentioned theory, in connection with an article ‘Zur Soziologie des Imperialismus’, the ‘origins’ by the article ‘Die sozialen Klassen im ethnisch homogenen Milieu’, which contains also a theory of the generation of social classes and class mobility, and the ‘decline’ by the book Kapitalismus, Sozialismus und Kommunismus. Capitalism will break down, because continuous economic success would destroy the indispensable bases. It is also often overlooked that Schumpeter already 1917 agreed with Max Weber and Pareto on the scope and methodology of sociology, thus stating, that sociology was a science free of value judgements dealing with the interactions between individuals and groups of individuals in a social entirety. Not only extend sociological elements most of his publications—especially the works published when he lectured in Bonn on ‘Gesellschaftslehre’—he also conceded in a work published after his death, that Sociology, Economics, History and Statistics were entirely equally entitled, consequently concluding—after having already early recognized the common bases of Sociology and Economics—that ‘economic’ and ‘other’ actions could not be separated rigorously.

In particular, the study is focused on the extent to which decentralized decision‐making via a price regime can be relied upon to produce optimal solutions in both simple situations and those characterized by externalities, indivisibilities, and non‐convexities. Linear and non‐linear programming and non‐zerosum gam theory are used in an effort to determine proper institutional arrangements for acceptable solutions and to rationalize a type of zoning constraints. One of the conclusions is that the more complex the situation and the greater the characteristic value of various coalitions, the less the desirability of complete decentralization of decisions and the greater the desirability of a pricing device which operates under certain constraints.

The study has attempted to include three parts. First it has examined grain yield fluctuations and has selected the most significant factors influencing yields. These include resource inputs, technology, weather and chance. Second, the study has developed a method by which the influence of each factor on grain yields may be measured. Third, it has shown that grain yields can be forecast within an acceptable margin of error, based on the past pattern of weather cycles, the current trend of technical advance and a monthly assessment of rainfall and temperature during seeding, growing and harvesting periods in any given year. The findings from this study show that the predicted yields for each of the grain crops were reasonably close to the actual yields, demonstrating an adequate model used and the efficiency of the analytical technique employed. Additional work on this topic is necessary, firstly to explore other possible methods of analysis and, secondly, to extend the analysis to cover the other two prairie provinces on a district‐by‐district basis, in order to be able to provide more information regarding the crop predictions which may be useful to farmers, distributors, businessmen, and governments involved in decision making. © 1965 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","",""

Some authors are inclined to disparage the contribution of Patinkin to economic theory, others consider his writings as a new starting point of monetary economics. It is attempted to reconcile both views in stressing the consequences of the fundamental hypothesis implied in Patinkins integration of monetory and value theory, the assumption that prices are flexible. The role of administered prices is confronted with the real balance effect. It is argued that the problem raised by Patinkin is still there as Patinkins solution applies only for perfect competition. It is a theoretical problem of major importance to integrate monetary and value theory in case of imperfect competition. In practice the whole discussion is less important as there exists always a price level determined by the amount of money and the demand for cash. Copyright © 1964, Wiley Blackwell.

Some departments have been gradually increasing mathematics and statistics requirements which widen the gap between departments and increase the diversity in training. The only recommendation on which fair unanimity was found is that basic mathematics and statistics courses should include more applications useful to economics. The authors suggest better use of graduate student time through reorganizing the content in mathematics for economists courses and economic theory courses, and through replacing present language requirements with a secondary minor-such as mathematics. Carrying out the recommendations would raise the level of training in quantitative techniques without sacrificing other competencies. Summer courses for teachers and conferences to develop course content and to further consider problems of overall balance between training in quantitative techniques, economics proper and fields with human subject matter related to economics are suggested. © 1965, Oxford University Press.

The results of the study are consistent with the hypothesis that these farmers respond to economic incentives by allocating very efficiently the factors of production at their disposal, and with the hypothesis that their investment decisions tend to maximize returns to scarce resources. The economics of rotation explains the rapid adoption and expansion of rice production. It appears, however, that the initial development impact of rice is exhausted, and only the introduction of a bundle of new, profitable factors of production will give further impetus to development. © 1965, Oxford University Press.","",""

The value of the institutionalist tradition has been referred to with increasing frequency in this regard. The contributions and shortcomings of this tradition are well illustrated in Veblen's thought. The shortcomings, the principal subject of this paper, include (a) an inadequate treatment of economic motivation (b) a tendency to view the study of economic institutions as a substitute for, rather than a complement to, price theory (including the related disciplines of mathematical economics and econometrics) and (c) an inadequate exploration of the nature and significance of alternative institutions in their relation to economic development. In each of these respects the concepts and comparative analyses of Max Weber provide valuable additions to both methodology and theory. Weber's legacy deserves the attention of all those who believe that (to paraphrase Whitehead) economics should be a survey of possibilities, not a quarrel among irritable professors.

The discussion is aimed at unification and cohesion of engineering decision methods by means of a basic structure of applied decision theory centered in a simplifying abstraction of teleological behavior. The traditional course covers concepts and methods that are useful to the improvement of the efficiency with which engineering decisions are made, but textbooks lack organization, cohesion, and rigor. Suggested elements of the unifying structure are (1) the formulation of specific objectives from value potential, (2) the measurement of value, (3) the specification of available choices, (4) the prediction of outcomes, (5) the estimation of criterion functions, and (6) optimization processes. Engineering Economy is traditionally taught as a bagful of disorganized tools. As a student of Civil Engineering the author went through it twice, once as an undergraduate and once as a graduate (at different institutions and from very able professors) without grasping the basic concepts that should have been learned. Many methods, definitions, and problems were well embedded in the gray matter, but the collection resembled a child's tool box where things are packed carelessly without regard for saw teeth, plane and chisel blades, or probing fingers. There is little orderly arrangement that might make the tools more easily found and more effectively used. More recently the author has been faced with the task of teaching the course to senior engineering students. In the meantime, between second and third rounds, two graduate degrees were acquired, and a lot of time was spent studying operations research and economics. It is, perhaps, needless to say that the bag of tools has gained a startingly new significance. Everything has begun to slip neatly into a basic framework, and this produces a large question mark. Why are the textbooks on the subject written so as to obscure the unifying principles that are so basic to decision processes and all goal-oriented behavior? In the author’s opinion, the objective of the course is simply to study the improvement of the efficiency of teleological or goal-seeking behavior in the engineering context. There is room for vast improvement. The following discussion is a recommended step in that direction. © 1965 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

This is a basic theme of public exhortations to potential lenders and aid givers to afford more help. It is also accepted implicitly by most agricultural economists. Others feel that it is not alone a remedy to the retarded development of many parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as for example L. R. Martin in the discussion of “Market Structures for Economic Development” at the annual meeting of the American Farm Economics Association, August 1959.1 He recognized the importance of access to better equipment for transport, but then went on to stress the great need for individuals able to make rational economic decisions in their own environment, and with the vision and dedication to bring its “intractable” institutions into greater compatibility with economic development. © 1962, Oxford University Press.

These changes may have important implications for farmers and consumers, as well as for the firms operating in these industries. As a result, economists and those concerned with public policy have displayed increasing interest toward the impact of various growth methods, competitive practices and other phenomena bearing on the performance of these industries. These changes present enormous challenges and opportunities for agricultural economists. Until recently the industrial organization and performance of the agricultural industries have received scant attention by them. The magnitude of current intesest in this subject is suggested by the fact that 41 Agricultural Experiment Stations have projects dealing with some aspect of this problem. © 1961, Oxford University Press.

That law is a simple, empirical, and qualitative generalization of the relationship between income and food consumption. In some respects, it is comparable to the formulation of the relationship between price and consumption in the traditional law of demand. Because an important function of theory is to coordinate and explain observed facts, it is logical that such simple laws should need to be amplified in several directions in order to be useful in analysis of an increasingly complex food economy like that of the United States in the mid-twentieth century. © 1962, Oxford University Press.

He has introduced an index of such practical importance, especially in the absence of official quarterly estimates of gross domestic product that attention should be given to its theoretical basis. In Mr. Shaul's paper greater attention was given, however, to the conception of the index and the choice of variable. The method of Factor Analysis used by Mr. Shaul has had wide application in other scientific fields, particularly psychology, but has only in recent years received support for its use as a powerful method in economics. Although this paper is primarily concerned with the mathematical theory of the index, it is hoped that the treatment is sufficiently general to be of wide interest to economic statisticians in Southern Africa.

This inadequacy, I think, stems mainly from regarding competition as an abstraction unto itself, or as something apart from the social and economic institutions which condition it.

In conclusion may I summarise the main points of my paper? 1. During the ten years since the war there has been no repetition of the “Great Betrayal” that occurred after the First World War. On the contrary there has been an unparalleled expansion of output, first to meet the world food shortage and secondly to ease the strain on the balance of payments. 2. The time has now come to concentrate on reduction of inputs rather than on further increase of output—in particular to reduce the labour and resources, both home produced and imported, now devoted to the production of wheat, milk, pigs and eggs. 3. The strategic argument for maximurn food production in peace is examined and found wanting. 4. Post‐war world food shortages have been replaced by growing sufficiency. In the case of wheat the problem is how to dispose of a surplus in the four main exporting countries recently amounting to nearly for 1 years' world exports. 5. Study of trends in world food and population suggests that there is a long‐term tendency for food production to increase slightly faster than population growth. Products of peasant agriculture and family farms, much of which is sold for cash rather than for profit, tend to exchange on unfavourable terms with manufactures. The case for protection and subsidies thus rests on fear of competition of cheap imported food rather than on the likelihood of growing food shortage. 7. Agriculture can help to improve the balance of payments (1) by the use of less imported feed and fuel, (2) by less expenditure on goods that could be exported (e.g. machinery and fertilisers), and (3) by release of labour and resource: which could be put to more economic use in reducing imports (e.g. of coal) or in expanding exports. 8. Output of milk, pigs and eggs has been over‐stimulated. A lower level of guaranteed prices can be justified on three grounds: (1) that supplies of all three products are more than sufficient; (2) that they involve a drain on the balance of payments through excessive imports of feed; and (3) that they involve excessive subsidies, which contribute to inflationary pressures. 9. Too much wheat is being grown at excessive cost on marginal land. Owing to higher yields two million tons could probably be grown economically, on a smaller acreage than pre‐war, without any subsidy. 10. To focus discussion and illustrate the long‐term objectives proposed, a tentative pattern of production for 1960/61 is given in Table 1, together with a hypothetical calculation of aggregate farm sales, expenses and net income in Table 2. 11. Economy of labour, involving continued migration of farm workers and small farmers into industry, is both the corollary and the condition of higher net output and incomes per head in agriculture. 12. If the goal of a more competitive agriculture is to be realised, economic aid to small farmers will be needed, partly to finance amalgamation and re‐equipment of holdings, and partly to compensate those who are willing, or forced by economic circumstances, to vacate their farms. Statutory supervision and dispossession under Part II of the Agriculture Act should be abandoned, if maximum production per acre is no longer required in the national interest. The N.A.A.S. should be expanded and given wider responsibilities in the administration of economic aid for small farmers. Pilot farms, as in Holland, should be developed. More regional surveys, like the Mid‐Wales Investigation, should be set on foot. 13. There is no general shortage of capital for farming on present lines. Some extra capital is needed for increase of efficiency and productivity; but the amount required will not be excessive, if we are not aiming at increased gross output or maximum production per acre. 14. Technical efficiency is needed as a means to economic efficiency, which implies ability to compete with imported products. 15. Progress towards greater efficiency in marketing will be achieved by more competition and voluntary co‐operation, not by more statutory Marketing Boards. The Marketing Acts should be repealed or amended. One final word. I hope nothing I have said, or left unsaid, will lead anyone to suppose that I claim to speak with authority or special knowledge. I think we are all conscious that we lack a lot of relevant data which no one has got, and we are all a bit puzzled about what should or is likely to come next. This is what makes agricultural economics so lively and fascinating a study. In any case I am only too anxious to learn from my audience—be they farmers, economists or civil servants—what they think should be the next instalment of a long‐term policy for agriculture.

Unless one is ignorant or believes that little recently developed theory is useful, to present such a survey in 30 or 40 minutes is a large order.

Consequently, my remarks may prove somewhat superficial to those of you who are familiar with some of the fields and too brief to be informative for those who are unfamiliar with the areas I will attempt to describe. In trying to avoid this danger, I'll restrict my comments to a few developments.

In 1827, Valentine B. Horton, who was later to become a Whig congressman and to make and lose a fortune, became “a professor of Moral Philosophy and Political Economy” at the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy, the forerunner of Norwich University.1 During the 1840s and ′50s, many engineering schools included a few lectures in moral philosophy and political economy in their programs. More formal and more enthusiastic promotion of economics on engineering campuses was evident under the aegis of Francis Amasa Walker, a noted economist and statistician, who, after service at the Sheffield School at Yale, became president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the early l88Os. Under his guidance, and that of Davis R. Dewey, who became an assistant professor of Economics and Statistics at M.I.T. in 1888, economics began to flourish on at least one engineering campus. © 1960 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The economic happenings in human society are so complicated and manifold that it is not possible to establish a comprehensive theory. Theorists in economics have always been obliged, in the first place, to deduce simple processes from a few fundamental phenomena. They have to take progressively more and more phenomena into consideration in their models, if they want to provide practitioners—whether economic policy‐makers or enterprisers—with a set of instruments serving to explain the causal nexus underlying the economic phenomena of society. It is dangerous to set up a theoretical model—say, the traditional model of a market with perfect competition—as a goal for economic policy, if the said model is not accessible to genuine value judgements. Furthermore, a large group of models will not, without reservation, lend themselves to the drawing of inferences for economic policy, because, owing to the axioms upon which they are based, they are not able to show those connections in the development of the economic processus of society which are brought about by technical improvements, growth of population, changes in consumer habits, etc. While in the twenties and thirties a growing accumulation of factual material without any theoretical interpretation confronted an abundance of theoretical models without empirical substance, developments in economic theory—especially in macro‐economics—during the last fifteen years or so, and developments in practical research, as practised in, say, the U. S. A., the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries, have been characterised by an effort to bridge this gap. Thus, modern theorists are trying to construct statistically testable models which will enable policy‐makers to gauge the effect of their measures with greater accuracy. National accounting and the models for analysing the interdependence of the processes of production and the connections between income, savings, consumption and investment represent attempts to fill up this gap which have, in some respects, scored a considerable success. We are by no means in sight of the end of developments in this branch of theory, especially as regards dynamic theory. The second important characteristic of the newer economic theory is the further development of market theory. Here, promising attempts are being made, through a conception of a systematic theory of economic behaviour with the aid of the theory of games, to lift economic subjects out of the state of quasi‐isolation which in traditional market theory exists, and to make it possible for morphology to be incorporated in economic theory.

Having chronicled earlier the course of its fatal disease, and now written its obituary, what more can he say? Let us not beg the question; he can celebrate a prolonged wake or frequent reinterments and perform endless autopsies, having indeed already delved into the post mortem in other contexts under such prophetic titles as “What To Do After the Undertaker Comes”2 and “To the Last Man, to the Final Shot/” But the sigh of relief would have been premature for idiomatic reasons anyhow, for none can tell whether Galbraith has written ex ante or ex post, his bedside manner being indistinguishable from his funereal. Death differs from life only in degree in the Galbraith idiom, in which an unlimited supply of adverbs may be called upon in resisting the dichotomy-we may be temporarily, seemingly, unhappily, obviously, or even admittedly dead, but we'll never be dead dead, Galbraith, then, will return to the pages of the Journal, and interested readers may be expected to witness the continuing spectacle of his challenging allegations going unnoticed by those against whom they are directed.

However, if economics is considered as an empirical (substantive) science which starts from actual human needs and places man's dependence upon and interaction with his natural and social environment in the center of its investigation, the basic concepts and conclusions of the behavioral sciences cannot be dispensed with. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Nationalökonomie und die Wissenschaften vom menschlichen Verhalten. So lange die Nationalökonomie als eine rein formale Wissenschaft vom menschlichen Handeln (Praxeologie) begriffen wird, erscheinen die grundlegenden Konzeptionen und Erkenntnisse der Verhaltenswissenschaften wie der Psychologie, der Soziologie und der Kulturanthropologie für die ökonomische Analyse als irrelevant. Wenn indessen die Nationalökonomie als wirklich empirische Wissenschaft betrachtet wird, die von den tatsächlichen menschlichen Bedürfnissen ausgeht und die Abhängigkeit des Individuums von seiner natürlichen und sozialen Umgebung sowie deren Wechselwirkung in den Mittelpunkt ihrer Forschungen stellt, so können die grundlegenden Konzeptionen und Folgerungen der Verhaltenswissenschaften nicht übergangen werden. RÉSUMÉ Ľ economie politique et les sciences du comportement humain. Tant que ľéconomie politique sera concue comme une science purement formelle de ľ action humaine (praxéologie), les concepts fondamentaux et les découvertes des sciences du comportement humain telles que la psychologie, la sociologie et ľ anthropologie culturelle seront considéréd comme de peu ď importance pour ľ analyse économique. Cependant, si ľéconomie politique est considérée comme une science effectivement empirique qui part des besoins humains réels et place la dépendance de ľ homme de son ambiance naturelle et sociale ainsi que ľ action réciproque de cette dernière au centre de ses recherches, les conceptions et conclusions fondamentales des sciences du comportement humain ne peuvent etre négligées. The question then arises as to the proper method by which the results of one field of inquiry can be utilized in another. Such integration is possible only if we find or formulate common denominator concepts sufficiently broad to contain and cut across the subject‐matter of several social disciplines. Which particular concepts are likely to prove useful for a “substantive” science of economics depends upon the nature of the central research problems of contemporary economic analysis. Since these germinal questions of modern economics are all related to the behavior of social groups and of individuals acting as members of structured social entities the basic concepts and findings of social psychology and cultural anthropology are likely to prove most useful for the substantive‐empirical economist. Having outlined the major concepts which have proved helpful in the analysis of group decisions and the individual‐group relationship the article concludes by setting forth the thesis that a substantive science of economics must be conceived from the very outset as an integral part of a science of man and culture. Such a “humanization” of economics would have the task of placing the living human being once more in the center of economic analysis and, at the same time, would provide a starting point for the solution of the urgent task of integrating our contemporary knowledge about man and culture. Es stellt sich dann die Frage, durch welche Methode die Ergebnisse des einen Forschungsgebiets im andern verwendet werden können. Eine solche Integration ist nur dann möglich, wenn für die verschiedenen Konzeptionen gemeinsame Nenner gefunden oder formuliert werden können, die weit genug sind, um den Gegenstand verschiedener Sozialwissenschaften zu umfassen. Welche Konzeptionen sich für eine wirklich empirische Wissenschaft als nützlich erweisen dürften, hängt von der Natur der zentralen Forschungsprobleme der heutigen ökonomischen Analyse ab. Da alle diese grundlegenden Fragen der modernen National ökonomie sich auf das Verhalten sozialer Gruppen und des Einzelnen beziehen, die als Glieder sozialer Gebilde von bestimmter Struktur handeln, dürften die grundlegenden Konzeptionen und Erkenntnisse der Sozialpsychologie und der Kulturanthropologie für den empirischen Ökonomen von grossem Nutzen sein. Nach einer Skizzierung der hauptsächlichsten Konzeptionen, die sich für die Analyse von Gruppenentschlüssen und der Beziehung zwischen Individuum und Gruppe als nützlich erwiesen haben, wird die These aufgestellt, dass eine wirklich empirische Nationalökonomie von allem Anfang an als ein wesentlicher Teil einer Wissenschaft vom Menschen und der Kultur begriffen werden muss. Eine solche “Humanisierung” der Nationalökonomie hätte zur Aufgabe, den Menschen ‐ so wie er in Wirklichkeit ist ‐ in den Mittelpunkt der ökonomischen Analyse zu stellen, und würde gleichzeitig den Ausgangspunkt darstellen für die Lösung der dringenden Aufgabe, unser gegenwärtiges Wissen über den Menschen und die Kultur zu integrieren. La question se pose alors de savoir par quelle méthode les résultats ď un domaine de recherche peuvent etre utilisés dans ľ autre. Une telle intégration n'est possible que si nous trouvons ou formulons pour les différentes conceptions des dénomina‐teurs communs suffisamment larges pour contenir ľ objet des diverses sciences sociales. Quelles sont les conceptions pouvant se révéler utiles pour une science réellement empirique, voilà qui dépend de la nature des problèmes majeurs de recherches de ľ analyse économique actuelle. Comme toutes ces questions fondamentales de ľéconomie politique moderne se rapportent au comportement de groupes sociaux et de particuliers agissant en tant que membres ď entités sociales ď une structure déterminée, les conceptions fondamentales et les découvertes de la psychologie sociale et de ľ anthropologie culturelle devraient etre ď une grande utilityé pour ľéconomiste empirique. Après avoir esquissé les principales conceptions qui se sont révelées utiles àľ analyse des décisions de groupes et des rapports entre ľ individu et le groupe, ľ article se termine par ľnonce de la these qu'une Economic politique reellement empirique doit etre concue des Tabord commcar; part intégrante ď une science de ľ homme et de la culture. Une telle “humanisation” de ľéconomie politique aurait pour tǎche de placer ľ homme ‐ tel qu'il est en réalité ‐ au centre de ľ analyse économique et représenterait simultanément le point de départ de la solution de la tǎche urgente consistant à intégrer notre connaissance actuelle de ľ homme et de la culture.

In a recent Ohio study the budgetary approach has been used to evaluate the economics of conservation farming on Muskingum and associated soils. This analytical method has certain advantages over others that have been commonly used. It permits holding constant all factors except the ones being studied. © 1955, Oxford University Press.

Again specialization has been thought of in regard to the direction in which one applies the tools of economics, either to the questions of public policy, production or consumption, and marketing. Probably to facilitate administration, the latter area is frequently subdivided according to commodities. While the institutional aspects of marketing individual commodities may differ the analytical techniques are the same. Individuals who concern themselves with marketing of potatoes or with marketing of butter may become institutional specialists but the analytical tools which they use and their application of economic principles must be the same. Again the same economic logic applies in determining the amount of grain to feed to a dairy cow or the amount of fertilizer to apply to com. © 1954, Oxford University Press.

(2) He believes that some attempts to study economic growth have invariably fallen into the dilemmas of welfare theories. All of us will agree with him on the first reaction that the state of welfare economics is not satisfactory. On the second, we may not be so unanimous. The central theme of Professor Clodius’ paper is in the direction of reviewing the literature and evaluating the tools available to economists in making analyses of problems existing in a growing economy.

More recently, the mere amassing of data has been given new meaning by the growth of applied economics. The attempt to interpret facts, the essential of applied economics, has not, however, made the progress that might have been expected. For one thing, the old idea of statistics as the mere assembly of figures still holds out attractions for the unadventurous. Much of the current effort of statisticians, whether in Government service, the universities or in private trade, goes into marshalling facts in publications which vie with Bradshaw in complexity and in painting broad pictures that make only minor contributions to our knowledge of ‘the way things work’. In this respect statisticians have much in common with librarians whose happiness seems to depend on having books on the shelves rather than in use. Again, the attraction of a quick return for a minimum of effort has meant that research has not developed as uniformly as it might have done. In some fields a wealth of information has resulted in comparatively detailed research, but there is still a large area where little work has been done. Copyright © 1954, Wiley Blackwell.

Economics, beset with all the complications in the nature of social studies, is certainly no exception to this rule. But authors availing themselves of such tools must remain conscious of exactly what they are doing, and must, in particular, be bound by the limitations of their models. To take an example from the natural sciences, it would be quite proper to construct a 'model' by assuming that light acts as if it consisted of particles of colloid crystals. What might perhaps be considered as somewhat unscientific is to refuse to investigate closely whether this hypothesis can be verified, or claim (supposing that it were mathematically a 'simple' case) that in order to save the determinateness of the solution, or the mathematical beauty of the structure elaborated, we should continue to work and prescribe further experiments on the basis of the colloid model, the facts of life notwithstanding. © 1949, Oxford University Press.

His discussion has centered primarily on the problems involved in the usual sort of aggregative analysis of agricultural prices--and I think he has done a good job of summarizing the statistical problems in this field. This is, indeed, a very important part of price research. But I feel sure that another aspect of price research should be given increasing attention--namely that of concentrating further work on narrower segments of the field and of developing some of the sorts of research mentioned by Nichols in his recent article on ""Marketing and Price Research"" in the Journal of Farm Economics. For various reasons I believe substantial results will be achieved by focusing much more attention on these sorts of studies. Effective use of market research funds requires better coordination of marketing and price research. © 1949, Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.","",""

He pointed out the economic policies in his time that would lead to the greatest political and social welfare of the individual countries and the world, As this social science developed during the century following Smith, it became a more abstract, “ivory tower,” deductive, theoretical analysis centered around maximizing profits of the individual firm and to a lesser degree the industry. Ir tended to seal itself off from the aspects related to the political and social welfare of society. Economics, like many of the social sciences, evolved and developed around a hub without seeing the rim around the whole economy; consequently, economics as well as other social sciences often exhibited a tendency to be inflexible and unadaptable. © 1949, Oxford University Press.

From this research have come some very “good answers”; but what are the questions? Or as Professor Jacob Viner stated a somewhat similar problem in discussing Frederick C. Mills' Behavior of Prices: “Professor Mills has made a valuable contribution to the statistical tools useful in the search for answers to questions concerning economic relations, once the questions have been asked. From the point of view of economic theory, the only criticism to be made of his work is his apparent satisfaction with a technique ill adapted to finding out what questions to ask.”1 With regard to supply analysis in agriculture it is not “a leaky roof that needs to be repaired but a foundation that needs to be reconstructed.”. © 1951, Oxford University Press.

Nobody doubts that in the difficult period of transition that must follow immediately upon the declaration of peace, some portion, at all events, of the control must be retained but on the question of how far similar control is appropriate as a permanent peace time policy, there is acute controversy.”? Professor Pigou made the above statement at the end of the First World War. Government intervention in marketing of agricultural products is not new. For many years there has been controversy over the degree to which such control is desirable.

I happen to be familiar with the work in Minnesota and I know some giant strides have been made in recent years in Peterson’s state toward integrating farm management training into the vocational agriculture program. You will note Professor Peterson has stressed that the initiative for more realistic training in farm management at this level should rest with workers in agricultural economics. I believe the success of the program in Minnesota is, in a large degree, due to the farm management people there having found a receptive and understanding ear among the leaders in the vocational agriculture program. I am not sure others of us interested in the same thing would be so fortunate. © 1952, Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.","",""

The truth is that the Plains have not changed but have merely been demonstrating the extreme variations in production which prevail in an economy geared to a critical climate. This extraordinary economic zone is located between two great divides. On the west the boundary is well defined by the Rocky Mountain Watershed divide. On the east is a climatic boundary which we have failed to recognize until lately. The climatic divide is of greater importance than the continental divide since it is also the economic boundary. It is here that the ordinary concepts of economics fail under very great strain imposed by critical climate This divide, according to Thornthwaite, falls on a line which can be drawn about straight south from Fargo, North Dakota. He calls it the zero line which marks the division between the moisture surplus areas and the moisture deficient areas. © 1949, Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.","",""

Other things being equal, community facilities and rural services vary directly with the density of the population. This is illustrated by a recent Bureau of Agricultural Economics study1 which classified the 3,071 counties of the United States by the proportion of farm people in the county. In the most rural counties (farm population 80 percent of total) 28 percent of births were in hospitals in 1946; in the most urban counties (farm population 20 percent of total) it was 93 percent. The most rural counties had 45 hospital beds per 100,000 population and the most urban, 432 beds; the former had 31 physicians per 100,000; the latter 432. Ten percent of adults in the former had completed high school; in the latter, 27 percent. Of the farm dwellings in the most rural counties, 19 percent had electricity as against 68 percent in the most urban (1945); seven percent of the farm dwellings in the most rural counties had running water, and 47 percent in the most urban counties. Four additional items included in the study show similar differences. © 1950, Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.","",""

Offered here are a few suggestions on what might usefully be taught to high school students and to adult students at a level below college.

It is not a final summary of a job completed. The setting and circumstances which caused it to become what it is ate described briefly in the following paragraphs. South Dakota is an agricultural state which sprawls across the Great Plains transition from Corn Belt to arid lands. It is characterized by rich soils, variable weather, and an extensive, high risk agriculture. The State was settled between 1850 and 1920 under federal laws which were intended to cover the expanse with 160-acre, family type owner operated farms. The land, the climate, and the economic situation combined to thwart this purpose. The percentage of tenancy rose for 50 years and reached 58 percent in 1940, farm numbers decreased steadily after initial settlement, farm sizes increased, and tenure problems multiplied. In 1947 the Agricultural Economics staff at South Dakota State College decided to initiate more intensive study of farm tenure. Before this, there had been studies by the department on landlord-tenant relations and on certain general aspects of tenure. © 1951, Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.","",""

These series together with a somewhat precise description of data and methods of the Bureau are presented here. Within the period from 1922 through 1932, the Bureau developed three distinct types of series. Each new one was considered an improvement over the preceding type, resulting in part from the technical experience gained, in part from the changing economic situation of farmers and the consequent intensified need for farm tax information, and in part from the greater availability of data. © 1937, Oxford University Press.

In many states, the agricultural economists have been pioneers in this field. But it is not necessary or appropriate for me to discuss their work at this time. When I was asked to discuss this paper, my first reaction was that efficiency in local government could not be measured: My present reaction is that Professor Renne (though he has made an excellent beginning) has not yet devised a method of measuring efficiency, but has merely developed “unit costs.” Any analysis of “unit costs” is, however, an important contribution. It is certainly more accurate or more refined than merely considering the total expenditures of an office, or the total expense of a particular service. But unit cost does not measure efficiency. Early in the paper, Professor Renne admits that it ignores the qualifications of personnel and the quality of the service, such as its accuracy and completeness. But he also ignores the important fact that governments nowadays must render certain public services, even though they may be very expensive. Health and welfare work are examples. In such cases, efficient service would probably demand a relatively high unit cost, if that idea were applied; and the less inefficient service would have a relatively low unit cost. Certainly low unit cost would seldom indicate their efficiency. © 1937, Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.","",""

The Measurement of Success. The problem of measuring success by direct and indirect evidence is discussed. It is proposed to examine the advantages of the large stores and organizations under two broad heads—those which arise from a monopolistic or monopsonistic position, and those which arise from economies of scale. 2. Monopolistic and Monopsonistic advantages. Evidence is produced to show that no advantage in respect either of higher prices or higher Percentage Gross Margins is enjoyed by large enterprises. They are, however, undoubtedly able to buy more cheaply. They are also able to afford higher per unit ‘ selling costs ’ (Publicity, Delivery and other services) which should enable them to attract and maintain a greater volume of sales. 3. Economics of sale. These higher unit selling costs are possible because the other Operating Expenses of large enterprises are lower. They are lower firstiy because of the rising productivity of labour with size, and secondly because the cost of holding stocks does not increase proportionately with sales. 4. Conclusion. Thus the trends towards greater concentration portrayed in our first article are given a basis in the greater profitability of large enterprises. It remains to discuss whether that profitability is achieved at the expense of the consumer. © 1946 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","",""

With the first efforts in agricultural extension, the importance of this work became apparent, and leaders in the field recognized that the relationship of different projects and the organization of the entire farm business was one of the most important considerations in any program of agricultural improvement. During the last generation, farming in our leading agricultural sections, had changed from a largely self-sufficing industry where the activity of the family had been directed chiefly toward supplying material for the household and preparing land for future production, to a strictly business enterprise.

What is he there for? For what range of vocations is he training himself? Is he in ah agricultural course in order to learn to farm? It is gratifying to know that at least some of our students have this objective. Let us hope that a higher proportion may be with us for that purpose as time goes on. Is the agricultural student in college to become a professional man in teaching, research, extension, and other fields of activity connected more or less closely with agricultural education? Certainly many of them are with us for that purpose if we judge by the vocational destination of the students who have gone through our colleges in the last few years. Are many of them taking agricultural courses in order to equip themselves for business vocations in fields closely allied to agriculture such as co-operative marketing, real estate, and the like? Adequate statistics as to the employment of agricultural college graduates would probably show that there is a growing proportion seeking employment in this field. Doubtless all of these motives and many others are responsible for the present enrollment in agricultural colleges. © 1928, Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.","",""

Drawing on the newspaper-based uncertainty indices by Baker et al. (2016, Measuring Economic Policy Uncertainty. Quarterly Journal of Economics 131 (4): 1593–1636), we first use the Diebold and Yilmaz (2014 On the Network Topology of Variance Decompositions: Measuring the Connectedness of Financial Firms. Journal of Econometrics 182 (1): 119–134) connectedness index methodology to investigate the static and dynamic patterns of EPU spillovers. We find substantial spillovers across the European countries. Over time, Germany in particular has become increasingly connected to the other economies. In a second step, we investigate the economic impact of EPU shocks using a structural VAR. The detrimental influence of uncertainty turns out to be regime-dependent. We identify a pre-crisis, a crisis and a post-crisis regime, and the effect is only significant in the former two. Finally, the impact of EPU shocks is also heterogeneous across the monetary union’s most important members. © 1863 De Gruyter Oldenbourg.

What is meant by coordination of research? On first thought it may mean the bringing together of the results of individual or institutional research. The analysis and then the synthesis of the findings of independent investigators seems to be a fruitful project when applied to studies in the physical and biological fields where many individual scientists have bored into the unknown, each in his own way and in his own place. Many farm management investigations, if the pioneer surveys can be called investigations, were conducted quite independently of each other, although in this case the methods employed were very similar for most of them followed the original copy. Studies in marketing have not yet proceeded very far. Nevertheless one needs only to read the list of marketing projects compiled for the Purnell committees or the list of doctoral dissertations in agricultural economics to be impressed with the very wide range of studies already attempted and completed, under way or proposed. In the interest of scientific accuracy and uniformity and comparability of methods and results, studies bearing on one commodity, service, or institution should be brought together, the methods and results compared, the findings evaluated,. the discrepancies and inadequacies pointed out, and new projects outlined to cover fields partially or wholly unworked. Very little of such SYnthesis has been made. © 1926, Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.","",""

On July I, 1894, I went to Pullman, Washington, as Professor of Agriculture and agriculturist to the State Experiment Station. The country was new to me and very different from anything I had ever seen. I. planned an elaborate list of experiments with a view to finding out as much as I could about the agriculture of the State. Later I had the opportunity to travel widely over the State in connection with the Farmers Institutes, which gave me an opportunity to learn that the more progressive farmers of the State already knew at least hall of what I was trying to find out. I was so much impressed with the vast amount of knowledge the better class of farmers had that in January, 1902, when I carne to the National Department of Agriculture and found myself at liberty to plan my own work, I chose to begin the deliberate study of farm practice, with a view to getting together and analyzing the knowledge farmers had already gained in their experience. © 1922, Oxford University Press.
